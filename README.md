# README for Simple Chatbot with NLP

## Overview
This repository contains a simple chatbot implemented using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined patterns and responses, making it a great starting point for understanding basic NLP concepts and chatbot development.

## Features
- **Greetings and Basic Interactions**: Responds to greetings like "hi," "hello," and "hey."
- **Dynamic Responses**: Handles user-specific inputs such as names (e.g., "my name is Alice").
- **Contextual Understanding**: Provides relevant responses to queries like "how are you?" or "what is your name?"
- **Exit Command**: Allows users to exit the chat by typing "quit," "bye," or "exit."
- **Fallback Responses**: Handles unrecognized inputs with prompts to rephrase or elaborate.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library (installed automatically if not present)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-nlp.git
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the chatbot script:
   ```bash
   python Chatbot-NLP.ipynb
   ```
2. Interact with the chatbot in the terminal. Example inputs:
   - "Hello"
   - "How are you?"
   - "My name is John"
   - "Tell me about Python"
   - Type "quit" to exit.

## Code Structure
- **`Chatbot-NLP.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the chatbot implementation.
  - Installs NLTK if not already installed.
  - Defines patterns and responses for the chatbot.
  - Implements the `simple_chatbot()` function to handle user interactions.

## Customization
To extend the chatbot's functionality:
1. Add more patterns and responses to the `pairs` list in the notebook. For example:
   ```python
   [
       r"what is (.*) made of",
       ["%1 is typically made of...", "The composition of %1 includes..."]
   ]
   ```
2. Modify the fallback responses to better suit your use case.

## Example Interaction
```
Hi! I'm a simple chatbot. Type 'quit' to exit.
> Hello
Hi! What can I do for you?
> My name is Alice
Nice to meet you Alice!
> Tell me about chatbots
chatbots is an interesting topic! What specifically would you like to know?
> quit
Goodbye! Have a great day!
```
